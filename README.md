## Usage and Operations
- Draw randomly colored rectangles with the mouse.
- Double-click on a rectangle to rotate it through 360Â°.
- At the end of the rotation, delete the rectangle.
- If you double-click several rectangles at once, wait until all rotations have been completed before deleting them.
- A button allows you to repaint with the same random color the two rectangles with the smallest difference in area. In the event of a tie, choose the first pair of rectangles meeting the condition.
